# bamazon


1. What the project does

Bamazon is a simple 'Amazon'. The customer is given a list of products that they can select and purchase.

2. Why the project is useful

This project was useful in seeing how I can use Javascript to change, read, update or delete items in the MYSQL database. 

3. How users can get started with the project

Upon connection to the MYSQL database the user will be given a list of items for purchase that have an order id number and price. They will be prompted for the item number of the 
item they would like to purchase and quantity of the item. Then inventory is checked to make sure there is enough in inventory, if there is they will be given their order total, if
there is not they will be told there is not enough in inventory.
